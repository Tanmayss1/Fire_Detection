# Fire_Detection



For-rest from Fires (Fire Detection Model using Deep Learning)
Problem Statement:
Lately, there have been many fire outbreaks which is becoming a growing issue and the damage caused by these types of incidents is tremendous to nature and human interests. Such incidents have highlighted the need for more effective and efficient fire detection systems.
The traditional systems that rely on temperature or smoke sensors have limitations such as slow response time and inefficiency when the fire is at a distance from the detectors.
 Moreover, these systems are also costly. As an alternative, researchers are exploring computer vision and image processing techniques as a cost-effective solution. One such method is the use of surveillance cameras to detect fires and alert the relevant parties.
Computer vision-based fire detection, which utilizes image processing techniques, has the potential to be a useful approach in situations where traditional methods are not feasible. The algorithm for fire detection uses visual characteristics of fires such as brightness, color, texture, flicker, and trembling edges to distinguish them from other stimuli.
This project is aimed at building a Fire Detection Model using Deep Learning.
Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to create a fire detection system. The key objectives of the project is to identify fires from the images we can get from surveillance system or other resources
Your focus in this project should be on the following:
The following is recommendation of the steps that should be employed towards attempting to solve this problem statement:
	Data collection: Collect data on different types of fires, including images and videos of flames, smoke, and heat. The data should be collected in a controlled environment to ensure that it is representative of real-world fires.
	Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is ready for use in training the deep learning model. This may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
	Model development: Use deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a model that can detect fires in the collected data. The model should be trained on the preprocessed data, and the accuracy of the model should be evaluated using the test set.
