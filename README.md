# Fire_Detection
Fire Detection Model Using Deep Learning

Problem Statement:
Lately, there have been many fire outbreaks, which is becoming a growing issue and the damage caused by these types of incidents is tremendous to nature and human interests. Such incidents have highlighted the need for more effective and efficient fire detection systems.
 The traditional systems that rely on temperature or smoke sensors have limitations such as slow response time and inefficiency when the fire is at a distance from the detectors.
 Moreover, these systems are also costly. As an alternative, researchers are exploring computer vision and image processing techniques as a cost-effective solution. One such method is the use of surveillance cameras to detect fires and alert the relevant parties.
Computer vision-based fire detection, which utilizes image processing techniques, has the potential to be a useful approach in situations where traditional methods are not feasible. The algorithm for fire detection uses visual characteristics of fires such as brightness, colour, texture, flicker, and trembling edges to distinguish them from other stimuli.
This project is aimed at building a Fire Detection Model using Deep Learning.
Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to create a real-time fire detection system. The key objectives of the project are:
•	To identify fires in their early stages, before they become large.
•	To create an affordable system for fire detection in real-time.
•	To design a system that can detect fires more quickly and accurately than conventional fire detectors.
Your focus in this project should be on the following:
The following is a recommendation of the steps that should be employed towards attempting to solve this problem statement:
•	Data collection: Collect data on different types of fires, including images and videos of flames, smoke, and heat. The data should be collected in a controlled environment to ensure that it is representative of real-world fires.
•	Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is ready for use in training the deep learning model. This may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
•	Model development: Use deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a model that can detect fires in the collected data. The model should be trained on the preprocessed data, and the accuracy of the model should be evaluated using the test set.
•	Integration with hardware: Integrate the deep learning model with hardware components such as cameras and sensors to create a fire alarm system. The system should be able to detect fires in real time and trigger an alarm or send an alert to the relevant authorities.
•	Testing and validation: Test the fire alarm system in a controlled environment to ensure that it can accurately detect fires and trigger the alarm in a timely manner. The system should also be tested in a real-world environment to ensure that it can handle different types of fires and environments.
•	Deployment and maintenance: Once the system has been tested and validated, it can be deployed in the intended location, and a maintenance plan should be put in place to ensure that the system is working properly and that the data and model are updated as needed.
Data: 
There are several sources of image data that can be used to build a fire detection system using deep learning
•	Public datasets: There are a few public datasets available that contain images of fires, such as the Wildfire Image Dataset (WID) and the Fire Detection Dataset (FDD). These datasets can be used to train a deep-learning model to detect fires in images.
•	Online resources: Websites such as YouTube and Vimeo have many videos of fires that can be used to extract images to train a deep-learning model.
•	Crowdsourcing: You can also use crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect images of fires from users.
•	Self-generated data: You can also generate your own data by simulating fires in a controlled environment and capturing images.
•	Surveillance cameras: You can use images from surveillance cameras in buildings, factories, and other public places to train your model.
